As you and your fellow explorers gaze across the uninhabited landscape of hexagonal tracts of terrain, you quickly realize that this unique land arrangement provides ample space for each of you to put down roots\n. You race off to establish your respective communities by gathering resources from nearby terrain, building your infrastructure, and nurturing trade relationships\n. Watch out for surprises— your rivals can block your path or send the robber to plunder your wealth! Good luck, explorers!

However, if only one player is affected, give that player as many of those resource cards as remain in the supply. TURN OVERVIEW CATAN is played over a series of turns, starting with the first player, and moving clockwise around the table\n. A turn consists of two phases, which occur in this order: 1. Production phase 2. Action phase Once you have finished the Action phase, if you have not won, pass the dice to the player on your left\n. They begin their turn with the Production phase. RULES Example: The White player rolls an 8. Blue has a settlement on the mountain hex with the number 8 disc, so Blue receives 1 ore resource card\n. Orange receives 2 ore for their city on that hex. RESOLVE A 7 When you roll a 7, hexes do not produce any resources. Instead: 1. DISCARD RESOURCES Each player who has more than 7 resource cards must choose half (rounded down) of their resource cards and return them to the supply"

Steal 1 random resource card from a player who has a building on that hex. If multiple players have buildings on the new hex, you choose one player to rob\n. Important: A hex with the robber does not produce resources when its number is rolled. Example: Orange rolls a 7. They move the robber to the pasture hex with a red settlement and a blue city\n. Orange chooses to steal a card from Blue and takes a random card without looking.
